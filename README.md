# Python-Rock-Paper-Scissors
a small experiment to dabble in python code 

Sunday August 6th 2023
the initial goal is to make a simple rock paper scissors game in python
with the prospect of adding (refining) how it looks and plays along
with any extra added features.
Im starting of with boilerplate code from  https://hackr.io/blog/python-projects
