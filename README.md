# Python-Rock-Paper-Scissors
a small experiment to dabble in python code 

Sunday August 6th 2023

the initial goal is to make a simple rock paper scissors game in python with the prospect of adding (refining) how it looks and plays along with any extra added features.

Im starting off with boilerplate code from  https://hackr.io/blog/python-projects

Bug : dislplays error message that is not persistent when user types an invalid option. eg- when typing H instead of R/P/S shows the error message only for a brief moment.

Error/Bug is not present when using PyCharm compiler
